Windows 8 Album App
============

A trivial Win8 album app that runs in the new Win8 run-time / platform (Metro).
Developed strictly to learn about MS Visual Studio 2012 for Windows 8, and the new Windows 8
app platform. This app is designed to run on the Microsoft surface; any media you want to show
must be placed in the <Project Path>/Assets/Album/ directory.
